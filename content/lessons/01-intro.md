# Introduction to PowerShell

Welcome to the PowerShell learning course! PowerShell is a powerful scripting language and command-line shell developed by Microsoft.

## What is PowerShell?

PowerShell is:
- A **command-line shell** for system administration
- A **scripting language** for automation
- An **object-oriented** framework built on .NET

## Why Learn PowerShell?

- **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks
- **System Administration**: Manage Windows, Linux, and macOS systems
- **Cloud Management**: Work with Azure, AWS, and other cloud platforms
- **DevOps**: Integrate with CI/CD pipelines

## Your First Command

Let's start with a simple command:

```powershell
Write-Host 'Hello, PowerShell!'
```

This command displays text to the console. Try running it in the editor!

## Key Concepts

1. **Cmdlets**: PowerShell commands follow a Verb-Noun pattern (e.g., `Get-Process`, `Set-Location`)
2. **Case Insensitive**: PowerShell doesn't care about case
3. **Comments**: Use `#` for single-line comments

## Safety Note

⚠️ **Important**: This is a sandboxed learning environment. Some commands are restricted for security. Focus on learning the concepts, not system manipulation.
